# Super Agent (MCP) Workflow Guide for Intel AI Assistant Builder

## Getting Started: Adding MCP Servers
Please refer to the **"Super Agent (MCP)"** section in the [user guide](https://aibuilder.intel.com/Intel%20AI%20Assistant%20Builder%20User%20Guide.pdf) to learn how to add MCP servers .

## MCP Server Support

Intel AI Assistant Builder supports wide range of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

### 1. Generated MCP Servers (mcp_codegen)
Custom MCP servers that can be automatically generated using our codegen framework located at [mcp/mcp_codegen](https://github.com/intel/intel-ai-assistant-builder/tree/main/mcp/mcp_codegen). These servers are purpose-built for Intel AI Assistant Builder, offering optimized performance and seamless integration with the platform's capabilities.

**Examples:**
Checkout our examples in [mcp/mcp_servers](https://github.com/intel/intel-ai-assistant-builder/tree/main/mcp/mcp_servers)
- Mindmap generation server
- Flight search server
- Hotel search server
- Math servers

**How to Build and Run:**
1. Each MCP server example contains a build script (`build.bat` or `build.sh`)
2. Run the build script in Command Prompt or PowerShell
3. After successful build, the executable will be available in the `dist` folder
4. **Prerequisites:** Python must be installed on your system to run the build scripts

**How to Add MCP Server to Intel AI Assistant Builder:**
1. In the Intel AI Assistant Builder UI, select **Command** as the connection type
2. Set the **MCP Server Command** field to the full path of your generated executable
3. Configure environment variables if needed (e.g., Flight and Hotel servers require `SERP_API_KEY` from [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com))

See the math server example below for reference:

### 2. Open Source MCP Servers
We also support community-maintained MCP servers from the official Model Context Protocol repository at [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers). These servers provide access to popular tools and services.

Below are three different methods to install and set up open source MCP servers:

#### Method 1: Using pip (Python Package Installer)

**Prerequisites:** Python must be installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.12 or later, which can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

**Steps:**
1. Install the MCP server package via pip (optionally in a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install mcp-server-time
   ```

2. **Important:** Add Python to your **System Environment Variables** (not User Environment Variables):
   - Add the Python installation path to System PATH
   - Example path: `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\`
   - **Restart your computer** for the system environment change to take effect
   - Or use the full Python path when configuring the MCP server like below

<img src="./images/pip-time.png" alt="pip time" width="50%">

#### Method 2: Using uvx (Universal Executor)

**Steps:**
1. Open PowerShell and install uvx:
   ```powershell
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. **Important Setup:**
   - The installation will show the uvx.exe download path
   - Add this path to **System Environment Variables** (not User Environment Variables)
   - **Restart your computer** for the system environment change to take effect
   - **Corporate Network Users:** Configure proxy settings (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) in System Environment Variables if your network requires proxy authentication for downloading libraries

<img src="./images/uvx-time.png" alt="uvx time" width="50%">

#### Method 3: Using npx (Node Package Executor)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js must be installed

**Steps:**
1. Download and install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

2. **Important Setup:**
   - Add `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\npm` to **System Environment PATH**
   - Replace `your_user_name` with your actual Windows username
   - **Restart your computer** for the system environment change to take effect

<img src="./images/npx-github.png" alt="npx github" width="50%">

### Troubleshooting Dependencies
Intel AI Assistant Builder runs as a Windows Service, which means it uses **System Environment Variables** instead of **User Environment Variables**. If your system is behind a corporate firewall, also add `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` to the System Environment.

**To test if Intel AI Assistant Builder can find your tools:**

1. Open PowerShell and simulate the service environment:
``` Powershell
$env:PATH=[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH','Machine')
```

2. Test if the required tools are available:
``` Powershell
Get-Command npx
Get-Command uvx
Get-Command python
Get-Command node
```

3. If any commands fail (even though you have Node.js/Python installed), Intel AI Assistant Builder won't be able to find them either.

4. **Solution:** Add the installation folders for `npx`, `uvx`, `python`, and `node` to your **System Environment PATH** (not User PATH).

5. Open a new PowerShell window and repeat steps 1-2 to verify the fix.

### Alternative Solution for Connection Closed Errors

If you're still experiencing "connection closed" issues after following the above steps, you can resolve this by using direct command execution with the proper interpreter prefix.

**Solution:** Use the full path to the interpreter when configuring MCP servers instead of relying on PATH resolution.

**For detailed instructions and examples, see:** [Fixing MCP Error 32000 Connection Closed](https://mcpcat.io/guides/fixing-mcp-error-32000-connection-closed/)

# Debugging MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder

## Method

All MCP call in Intel AI Assistant Builder follows 2 steps. By understanding these steps you will have enough understanding on how to debug MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder.

### Step 1 - MCP Agent Call
Every successful MCP call always start with calling agent. When Agent is called, it's indicated by the phrase `Call: <agent name>`. The most common problem here is `Your Prompt does not call your Agent`. The reason for this problem is **LLM unable to determine relationship between your prompt and the MCP Agent System Prompt**.

Take a look on the example below where we create relationship using random words. In the MCP Agent System Prompt, we specify it as `you have access to zebra tool. zebra tool will convert markdown to mindmap.` When we send the prompt `zebra this file C:\redacted\example\mcp_servers\mcp_mind_map\financial_report.md`, LLM sees relationship between our prompt and the MCP Agent system prompt.

![custom agent prompt](./images/debug-mcp-agent-2.png)


### Step 2 - Tool Call
When Tool is called, it's indicated by the phrase `Start calling tool <tool name>`. The most common problem here is `Your Prompt call incorrect tool`. The reason of this is similar to Step 1, **LLM unable to determine relationship between your prompt and the Tool name and/or descriptions**.



# Additional method to debug MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder

## Method 1 - Debug Logs
If you have access to Intel AI Assistant Builder Debug build, you can refer to the logs located at `C:\Temp\IntelAia\*.pyllmserv.log` and search for `/chat/completions` or `openai._base_client`.

## Method 2 - Wireshark
When you unable to get a Debug Build, you can always use `Wireshark` to sniff packets going back and forth to `ovms.exe` port. However, this method requires some understanding on how to use `Wireshark`.


### How to use Wireshark
1. [Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) and install `Wireshark`
2. Once installed, open and choose `Adapter for loopback traffic capture`. For our explanation purpose, it is safe to assume `loopback` is similar to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
    ![wireshark choose loopback](./images/wireshark-1.png)

3. Next, you are required to set filter. Click `localhost`, then type the filter you want, and finally click the arrow.
    - in our case, we want to sniff `ovms.exe` package that runs on port `8101`
        ```
        tcp.port eq 8101
        ```
    ![wireshark set filter](./images/wireshark-2.png)

4. Once you press the arrow, you are ready to sniff package. Start with a simple `hello` prompt in Intel AI Assistant Builder.

    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-3.png)

5. Your `Wireshark` should be showing the packets it able to sniff. The most interesting packet has green highlights. For now, we're interested with `POST /v3/chat/completions HTTP/1.1 , JSON (application/json)`. Click on the green line, and right click on the `JavaScript Object Notation: application/json` and copy it as `UTF-8 Text`

    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-4.png)

6. Using your favourite editor, you now have access to the payload sent from Intel AI Assistant Builder to the `ovms.exe`.

    ![wireshark hello json](./images/wireshark-5.png)

7. There is another interesting payload called `HTTP/1.1 200 (text/event-stream)` which is the result of the prompt. Since the payload is a stream, `Wireshark` helps us and de-chunked the entire body. If you copy it as `UTF-8 Text` , you can see the JSON returned by the `ovms.exe`.

    ![wireshark hello result](./images/wireshark-6.png)
    ![wireshark hello result](./images/wireshark-7.png)
    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-3.png)

### Using Wireshark to debug MCP calls

For MCP calls, there is 2 interesting payload to observe. `POST /v3/chat/completions HTTP/1.1 , JSON (application/json)` and `HTTP/1.1 200 (text/event-stream)`. However, MCP calls happened multiple times. So you might need to repeat the sniff process multiple time.

below are the example of debugging Mindmap MCP call.
