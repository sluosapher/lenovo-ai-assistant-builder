# Instructions to enable MCP agents in Intel AI Assistant Builder

## General Step to add MCP Server to Intel AI Assistant Builder

1. Launch Intel AI Assistant Builder and click Manage MCP Server.

    ![manage mcp server](./images/manage-mcp-server.png)
2. Click on the Add new MCP server info and a popup window will appear. The image below is using Mindmap MCP Server as an example.The actual configuration depends on the MCP Server configuration itself. Click Add once you complete.

    ![manage mcp server add](./images/manage-mcp-server-add.png)
3. If the MCP Server requires Environment Variable, you can fill it using the format shown below separated by a space.
```
ENV1:VALUE1 ENV2:VALUE2
```
4. Once added, you need to add the server to an agent. Make sure to select your MCP server from the dropdown list. The `Description` and `System Prompt` will affect the outcome of MCP call results.

## Dependencies
MCP capability for Intel AI Assistant Builder in general leverages on `NodeJS`, `Python`. Some of the most common MCP servers also leverage on `npx (npm package execute)` and `uvx (alias for uv tool run)`.
- `NodeJS >= v23.11.1`
- `Python >= 3.12.9`

### General guideline for debugging dependencies
Intel AI Assistant Builder runs it service as a `Services`. It also means Intel AI Assistant Builder will leverage on `System Environment` instead of `User Environment`. If your system is connected to a corporate firewall, you should also add `HTTP_PROXY`,`HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` to the `System Environment`.

1. In powershell, write this command. It will replace the current terminal's PATH
``` Powershell
$env:PATH=[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PATH','Machine')
```

2. Using the same terminal, you can test for `npx`,`uvx`,`python` and `node`. 
``` Powershell
Get-Command npx
Get-Command uvx
Get-Command python
Get-Command node
```

3. If you have NodeJS and Python installed in your computer but the command above fails, It means Intel AI Assistant Builder will not able to run those command.
4. To solve this, add `npx`,`uvx`,`python` and `node` folders to your `System Environment` `PATH`.
5. Repeat the steps in `a new powershell window` to verify your changes.

## Mindmap MCP Server

![mindmap mcp server](./images/mindmap-mcp.png)

Mindmap MCP Server will convert Markdown content to a mind map. The implementation are leveraging on nodejs tool called markmap-cli. 

### Steps to launch Mindmap MCP Server

1. git clone `https://github.com/intel/intel-ai-assistant-builder` and go to  the folder `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_mind_map`
2. in Powershell, run the command below to build `mind_map-mcp-server.exe`. This MCP server is generated using the scripts in `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_codegen`.

    ``` powershell
    cd mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_mind_map
    ./build.bat
    ```

3. once the build is complete, you can close the terminal and confirm the EXE is generated in the `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_mind_map/dist` folder.
4. You can now use Intel AI Assistant Builder UI to add the MCP server info

### Information for adding mcp_mind_map MCP Server to AI Assistant Builder

1. The MCP Server leverage `transport=sse`, which means the MCP Server expects all communication through network port. The EXE generated in the step above is a special EXE that will start the MCP server using command. see image for more info.

![Flight and Hotel mcp server part 2](./images/flight-and-hotel-mcp-2.png)

### Steps to launch Flight MCP Server and Hotel MCP Server

1. git clone `https://github.com/intel/intel-ai-assistant-builder` and go to the folder `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_google_flight`
2. in Powershell, run the command below to build `google_flight-mcp-server.exe`. This MCP server is generated using the scripts in `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_codegen`.

    ``` powershell
    cd mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_google_flight
    ./build.bat
    ```

3. once the build is complete, you can close the terminal and confirm the EXE is generated in the `mcp/mcp_servers/mcp_google_flight/dist` folder.
4. Repeat the same step for `mcp_google_hotel`.
5. at the end , you will have both `google_flight-mcp-server.exe` and  `google_hotel-mcp-server.exe`


### Information for adding Both Flight MCP Server and Hotel MCP Server to AI Assistant Builder

1. The MCP Server leverage `transport=sse`, which means the MCP Server expects all communication through network port. The EXE generated in the step above is a special EXE that will start the MCP server using command. see image for more info.

### Information for combining Flight MCP Server and Hotel MCP Server as a single MCP Agent
1. To make Flight MCP Server and Hotel MCP server work together, we need to specify it in the Agent System Prompt. Below are the information we use to generate the image above.
2. The result of the prompt depends on the Large Language Model used (LLM). But with the right Agent Name, Description and System Prompt, we can steer the LLM to get intended result.

| MCP Agent Information | Value                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MCP Agent Name        | flight hotel agent                                                                                                                                                             |
| Description           | flight and hotel agent description                                                                                                                                             |
| System Prompt         | you have access to both flight and hotel tool. if asked about both hotel and flight, always choose the first flight option and suggest hotel based on the first flight option. |
| MCP Servers           | select hotel and flight                                                                                                                                                        |

# Debugging MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder

## Method

All MCP call in Intel AI Assistant Builder follows 2 steps. By understanding these steps you will have enough understanding on how to debug MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder.

### Step 1 - MCP Agent Call
Every successful MCP call always start with calling agent. When Agent is called, it's indicated by the phrase `Call: <agent name>`. The most common problem here is `Your Prompt does not call your Agent`. The reason for this problem is **LLM unable to determine relationship between your prompt and the MCP Agent System Prompt**.

Take a look on the example below where we create relationship using random words. In the MCP Agent System Prompt, we specify it as `you have access to zebra tool. zebra tool will convert markdown to mindmap.` When we send the prompt `zebra this file C:\redacted\example\mcp_servers\mcp_mind_map\financial_report.md`, LLM sees relationship between our prompt and the MCP Agent system prompt.

![custom agent system prompt](./images/debug-mcp-agent-1.png)
![custom agent prompt](./images/debug-mcp-agent-2.png)


### Step 2 - Tool Call
When Tool is called, it's indicated by the phrase `Start calling tool <tool name>`. The most common problem here is `Your Prompt call incorrect tool`. The reason of this is similar to Step 1, **LLM unable to determine relationship between your prompt and the Tool name and/or descriptions**.



# Additional method to debug MCP in Intel AI Assistant Builder

## Method 1 - Debug Logs
If you have access to Intel AI Assistant Builder Debug build, you can refer to the logs located at `C:\Temp\IntelAia\*.pyllmserv.log` and search for `/chat/completions` or `openai._base_client`.

## Method 2 - Wireshark
When you unable to get a Debug Build, you can always use `Wireshark` to sniff packets going back and forth to `ovms.exe` port. However, this method requires some understanding on how to use `Wireshark`.


### How to use Wireshark
1. [Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) and install `Wireshark`
2. Once installed, open and choose `Adapter for loopback traffic capture`. For our explanation purpose, it is safe to assume `loopback` is similar to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
    ![wireshark choose loopback](./images/wireshark-1.png)

3. Next, you are required to set filter. Click `localhost`, then type the filter you want, and finally click the arrow.
    - in our case, we want to sniff `ovms.exe` package that runs on port `8101`
        ```
        tcp.port eq 8101
        ```
    ![wireshark set filter](./images/wireshark-2.png)

4. Once you press the arrow, you are ready to sniff package. Start with a simple `hello` prompt in Intel AI Assistant Builder.

    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-3.png)

5. Your `Wireshark` should be showing the packets it able to sniff. The most interesting packet has green highlights. For now, we're interested with `POST /v3/chat/completions HTTP/1.1 , JSON (application/json)`. Click on the green line, and right click on the `JavaScript Object Notation: application/json` and copy it as `UTF-8 Text`

    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-4.png)

6. Using your favourite editor, you now have access to the payload sent from Intel AI Assistant Builder to the `ovms.exe`.

    ![wireshark hello json](./images/wireshark-5.png)

7. There is another interesting payload called `HTTP/1.1 200 (text/event-stream)` which is the result of the prompt. Since the payload is a stream, `Wireshark` helps us and de-chunked the entire body. If you copy it as `UTF-8 Text` , you can see the JSON returned by the `ovms.exe`.

    ![wireshark hello result](./images/wireshark-6.png)
    ![wireshark hello result](./images/wireshark-7.png)
    ![wireshark hello](./images/wireshark-3.png)

### Using Wireshark to debug MCP calls

For MCP calls, there is 2 interesting payload to observe. `POST /v3/chat/completions HTTP/1.1 , JSON (application/json)` and `HTTP/1.1 200 (text/event-stream)`. However, MCP calls happened multiple times. So you might need to repeat the sniff process multiple time.

below are the example of debugging Mindmap MCP call.
