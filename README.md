## What's New
### Latest Release (Version 2.0.0)
- Introducing MCP Support
We’ve added Model Control Protocol (MCP) support, enabling seamless import/export of MCP servers and agents, improved error handling, and enhanced UI/UX for managing workflows. This lays the foundation for more flexible agent-based orchestration and integration with external systems.

- Introducing New OVMS Backend
A new OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) backend has been integrated into the system. This provides better scalability, cache handling for NPU/GPU models, and improved process management. It ensures more efficient model loading and execution, especially for large-scale workloads.

- Introducing Support for New Models
This release expands compatibility with Qwen3 (now the recommended model), and new NPU model configurations. These additions broaden the model ecosystem and improve flexibility for different use cases.

- New Workflows UI
A Custom Workflows UI has been introduced, providing users with more intuitive control over query flows, agent behaviors, and task automation. Enhancements include reusable components, better active file management, clickable references, and clear visual cues to differentiate current vs. recommended models. The MW and Backend APIs have been updated to improve clarity and simplify integrations.

- Improved Summarization & OOM Handling
Summarization has been significantly upgraded to include more context with multi-level and direct keyword-focused modes.
Overflow token and stop-chat handling fixes have been added to address out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

- Bug Fixes
This release addresses a wide range of issues, including CSV encoding errors, security vulnerabilities and regressions caused by dependency upgrades. These fixes collectively improve reliability and user experience across the platform.

### Earlier Versions

##### Version 1.2.2
- Enhanced Hardware Verification: We've refined our hardware check feature to ensure compatibility avoiding issues with the latest CPU models.

##### Version 1.2.1
- Service Only Installer
This installer will only install AI Assistant Builder service and backend. 

- Bug fix for Arrow Lake System
Fix installation issues with some Arrow Lake Systems. 

##### Version 1.2.0

- New Models Support
Intel(R) AI Assistant Builder now officially supports Qwen2.5-7B, Phi4-mini, and Deepseek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-7B.

- ModelScope Download Endpoint Support 
Intel(R) AI Assistant Builder now supports direct model downloads from ModelScope.cn, improving accessibility and convenience.

- Localization Support
Partial localization is available for Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans) and Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant). Language settings are automatically adjusted based on your Windows system language, but you may manually select the preferred language under *Settings > Appearance > Language*

- Admin Mode
Switch between a simple chatbot interface for "standard" users and an "Admin" interface with comprehensive configuration options. This enables administrators to configure, preview, and evaluate the end-user experience.

##### Version 1.1

- HF-Mirror for Users in PRC
The HF-Mirror provides users in the People's Republic of China with faster, more reliable access to models.

- Model Conversion to OpenVINO Format
The model conversion utility enables the conversion of most 'Text Generation' models to the OpenVINO format for immediate use in the assistant or wherever you plan to use a given model. You can convert models directly from Hugging Face or from a local folder. Optimized performance, compatibility, and efficiency of model execution are just a few benefits of this new utility. Please note that the model conversion utility does not work with all models, and it is important to verify the accuracy of any converted model.

- Import and Export Assistant
The new "Import and Export Assistant" feature simplifies the process of transferring data and configurations between computers and when conducting upgrades or re-installations. The option to export a "Built" assistant and allow another user to import it facilitates collaboration and sharing.

- New HR Special Query called Resume Match
The new HR assistant feature allows unlimited resume uploads in one session, intelligently scores resumes against job descriptions, extracts key details from top candidates using RAG, and facilitates continuous conversational analysis of documents.

- Update to Query Tabular Data
The Query Tabular Data feature now shows the SQL query used to generate the response, allowing users to verify, correct if necessary, and rerun the adjusted query.

- New Collect Metrics Parameter
The new Collect Metrics parameter, when enabled by the user, gathers performance metrics related to file ingestion and response generation, providing valuable insights.

##### Version 1.0

- User Interface
  - UX customization: Users can upload their own logo and customize additional app colors.
  - Users can upload their own LLM or RAG models. Instructions are provided to convert models to a compatible format. Intel does not guarantee that all models will work.

- AI Features
  - Query Summary: Users can attach up to three files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and generate a summary of each file, allowing them to ask follow-up questions based on the summary.
  - Query Tabular Data: Users can attach one file (XLSX, CSV). The data must be in tabular format, with headers in the first row and data in subsequent rows. This feature generates a description of the tabular data in each worksheet.
  - Query Images: Users can attach up to three files (PNG, JPEG, JPG) and generate a description of each image. This requires a vision model such as Phi-3.5-vision-instruct-int4-ov.

- NPU Model
  - NPU model support for Phi3-4K now offers an improved token length of 2K.

- New Assistant
  - Added Finance Assistant.
